# Crawl
A game based off of `Stone Soup: Dungeon Crawl`.

### Install
First, you need [`ruby`](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). You'll be wanting to grab a version that has `rubygems`. After you install that, run these commands:
```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```
or:
```
gem install gosu
gem install meiro
```

From there, you'll be wanting to run `game.rb`.
